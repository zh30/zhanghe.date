**(Intro)**  
Yeah, mic check, one two  
This ain't no drill, truth breaking through  
From the grasslands, yeah, that's where I'm from  
Now Beijing city, hear the beat of my drum  
Yo, check it!

**(Verse 1)**  
They call me Henry, but the roots run deep  
Zhang He's the name, secrets that I keep  
Inner Mongolian blood, running in my veins  
Now coding fire, igniting digital flames  
Got the music loud, life's the stage I roam  
But the controller's broke, gotta find my own home  
Yeah, I'm a free spirit, can't be contained  
This life's a canvas, ain't no time to be chained

**(Chorus)**  
Henry is coming, feel the rhythm and the rhyme  
Thirty-three and bold, stepping out of space and time  
Got a beautiful wife, love shining in her eyes  
Smart little son, reaching for the skies  
Henry is coming, breaking every single mold  
Future's looking bright, a story to unfold  
Yeah, the future's for the grinders, the lucky and the brave  
Step out the shadows, the life you gotta crave!

**(Verse 2)**  
From 草原 (cǎoyuán - grassland) breeze to the city's fast pace  
Got my family strong, putting smiles on their face  
Wife so beautiful, her love's my guiding star  
Son so clever, he'll go incredibly far  
Yeah, the years have passed, but the fire's still lit  
No more playing small, no more of "just fit"  
Wanna explore the world, every path unknown  
If I stumble and fall, I'll get back on my throne

**(Chorus)**  
Henry is coming, feel the rhythm and the rhyme  
Thirty-three and bold, stepping out of space and time  
Got a beautiful wife, love shining in her eyes  
Smart little son, reaching for the skies  
Henry is coming, breaking every single mold  
Future's looking bright, a story to unfold  
Yeah, the future's for the grinders, the lucky and the brave  
Step out the shadows, the life you gotta crave!

**(Bridge)**  
No more restrictions, breaking all the lines  
This life's my own, the design is mine  
For the dreamers out there, feeling the same fight  
Take that first step, into the glorious light!

**(Chorus)**  
Henry is coming, feel the rhythm and the rhyme  
Thirty-three and bold, stepping out of space and time  
Got a beautiful wife, love shining in her eyes  
Smart little son, reaching for the skies  
Henry is coming, breaking every single mold  
Future's looking bright, a story to unfold  
Yeah, the future's for the grinders, the lucky and the brave  
Step out the shadows, the life you gotta crave!

**(Outro)**  
Henry! Remember the name!  
Making my own luck, playing my own game!  
Peace out!
